# MVCFileCRUD - An interactive Bucket List website that also shows locations through the Google Maps API

This assignment was designed to test the ability for us to work through the new skills in SpringMVC. This includes using .jsp pages for the view. For myself, I designed my page so that the redirect always brought the user back to the initial welcome view. This was there was not much change made on the page, except that which the user made. Also, this limited the views, and as such possibility of it breaking.
